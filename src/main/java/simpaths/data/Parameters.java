     * Update the probability of sickness by age profile for those old enough to work, catering
     * for the change (increase) in retirement age in future years, by 'stretching' the
     * (approximated) curves for males and females using the instructions below.
     *
     * From Matteo:
     * " In every year we will evolve this fraction together with the state retirement age.
     * This means that the fraction of sick people at the minimum age (18) and at the maximum age
     * (the state retirement age) remain the same, and the fitted curve is scaled accordingly."
     *
     *	This means that if the fraction of people with bad health at age 60 is x% when state
     *	retirement age is 65, after state retirement age increases to 66 that fraction will be met
     *	at age 60/65*66 = 61 (rounded).
     *
     *	I don't mind using a cubic rather than a quadratic spline, try it out if you wish
     *	(differences are small). We can also use the actual numbers, I have used a spline just
     *	to smooth out the profiles.
